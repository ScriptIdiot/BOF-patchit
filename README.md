# Cobalt Strike BOF - patchit (Both syscalls and dynamic resolve versions are available)

An all-in-one BOF to patch, check and revert AMSI and ETW for x64 process. Wrote this to avoid redundant AMSI / ETW patch.

Currently, it only checks the first 10+ bytes of AmsiScanBuffer and EtwEventWrite, since most of public available patch bytes are doing on first few lines. If thats not enough, additional bytes / function to compare can be added easily to the source code.

If you are not using the AMSI/ETW patch from this BOF and want to revert, you could refresh the whole AMSI and NTDLL as an alternative.

*If there is no amsi.dll in current process, this bof will not load it to the process.*

**Update on 18 Aug 2022**

- Added a new version doing indirect syscalls for NtApi

**Update on 30 Sep 2022**

- Added callback unhook on syscall version
